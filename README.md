# Feedback-Collection---A-full-stack-web-application
A Full Stack Application where users (Service/Product owners) can send emails to their customers to provide the feedback. Users can login, pay for email credits through Stripe, create a new survey, enter a list of emails to send survey to and view the report of all survey responses.
Used React and Redux forms for the front end, Expressjs & Nodejs as the middleware and MongoDB to store and retrive the data. Deployed the application using Heroku.
Used Google OAuth and PassportJs to handle the authentication.
